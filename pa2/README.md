**Command order:**
1. `cd pa2/`
2. `make`
3. `./pa2 <initial lambda> <avg service time>`

Simulation for the scheduling and running of processes on a CPU. Uses a priority queue, arrival/departure handlers for processes, and variable lambda and average service time values. When running the program, please include two arguments. The first will be the initial lambda and the second the average service time.

*Note: You can use `make clean` to remove `.o` and executable files and run `make` again fresh.*
