**Command order:**
1. `cd pa2/`
2. `make`
3. `./pa2 <initial lambda> <avg service time>`

When running the program, please include two arguments. The first will be the initial lambda and the second the average service time.

*Note: You can use `make clean` to remove `.o` and executable files and run `make` again fresh.*
